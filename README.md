# TypeScript-crash-course

first Beginner TypeScript crash course i did following a youtube crash course made by Traversy Media

## dist
`dist directory` has the javaScript after TypeScript compilation

## src
`src directory` has the TypeScript code


## TypeScript terminal commands
`tsc` to run the .ts file and compile it to .js
`tsc --watch` to keep compiling automatically every time theres a change in the .ts file
